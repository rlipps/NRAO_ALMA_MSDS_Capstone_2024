The goal of this project is to assist those writing proposals to use the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope. Specifically, we aim to encourage more precise and effective observations with suggestions of frequency parameters based on the research proposal text. 

Once obtaining the determined "topic", "bands", and "cluster ranking" of the specified proposal text, view the following dashboard to dive deeper into the frequency ranges observed of similar proposal texts: https://capstonedashboard-8.onrender.com/

Notice that you can filter for your specified "topic" and "bands." Then, you can pay attention to the high scoring clusters for this specific proposal text. The hope is that through our model's predictions, you can look at the distribution of frequency ranges used by previous, similar projects. We suggest you take the count of observations in each frequency range and the width of each frequency range into account.
