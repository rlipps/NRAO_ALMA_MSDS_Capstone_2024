The Dynamics of Massive Starless Cores. Progress towards resolving a decade-long debate about how massive stars form can be made by determining if massive starless cores exist in a state of near virial equilibrium. These are the initial conditions invoked by the Core Accretion model of McKee & Tan (2003). Alternatively, the Competitive Accretion model of Bonnell et al. (2001) requires sub-virial conditions. We have identified 4 prime examples of massive (~50 Msun) cores from mid-infrared (MIR) extinction mapping (Butler & Tan 2009, 2011) of Infrared Dark Clouds. We have found spectacularly high deuterated fractions of N_2H+ of ~0.5 in these objects (Fontani et al. 2011). Thus N_2D+(3-2) becomes an excellent tracer of the kinematics of these cold, dark cores, where most other molecular tracers are thought to be depleted from the gas phase. ALMA Cycle 0 Compact Configuration Band 6 observations probe this line on scales from 9" down to 2.3", well-matched to the structures we see in MIR extinction. Sharing a 5 hour track between single pointing observations to each of the 4 cores, we have the sensitivity and uv plane coverage needed to measure the kinematics of these structures and thus determine whether or not they are near virial equilibrium.
